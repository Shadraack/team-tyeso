Your song

It took one look away everything change
And forever lay out in front of me
One smile, then I died
Only to be revived by you
There I was
Thought I had everything figured out
Goes to show just how much I know
'Bout the way life plays out
I take one step away
Then I find myself coming back to you
My one and only
One and only you
Ooh
Now I know
That I know not a thing at all
Except the fact that I am yours
And that you are mine
Oh
They told me that this wouldn't be easy
And no
I'm not one to complain
I take one step away
Then I find myself coming back to you
My one and only
One and only
I take one step away
Then I find myself coming back to you
My one and only
One and only you
